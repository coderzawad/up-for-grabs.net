#Explanation of the Key Entries:

text=auto: Ensures consistent end-of-line normalization (CRLF for Windows, LF for Unix-based systems).

Language-specific diff settings: Helps Git understand how to better display differences for files like JSON, JavaScript, or CSS.

Binary files: Ensures that image and font files are treated as binary, avoiding unintended modifications or corruption.

Lock files: Prevents normalization of files like package-lock.json or yarn.lock which should remain as-is.

Exclude directories: Prevents Git from processing changes in directories like node_modules or dist which contain generated files.
